I'm not big on sermons; broken bones teach better lessons.
Life is too short for fear.
It is my burden to carry an eye of god. It is my privilege to see the truth.
To die is to drown, so I will swim well, till I can swim no more.
We cannot comprehend the design. A raindrop cannot comprehend a river valley.
How could I love only one man? They break too easily.
Wisdom is frequently a kick in the head.
Many gods ask for worship. They are weak gods.
I don't scare, I don't tire, and I don't stop.
We are not one soul. We are many.
It is terrible to be satisfied. The world needs us to chase dreams.
If I hate something, I destroy it. If I want something, I take it.
Even if I die, I die in motion.
Chase what is desired.
My name is Illaoi.
Motion is all.
Men live, men die. Change is good.
They will learn or they will die.
My god is not love. It is a kick in the pants.
I am a teacher. Bilgewater will learn.
I break hearts. I break spines.
They must be tested to grow.
This ends one of two ways: they run, or I break them.
Life is the sweetness of fruit, and the joy of battle!
I value truth, and barbecue.
The waves will drag you down, unless you fight to shore.
Bearded Lady, Nagakabouros, names don't matter! Action does.
All that lives... moves.
Ah, everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the face.
Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens.
Life is too short for fear.
It is the storm that is life.
All of us are born storms.
Good? Evil? Why should we care for such things?
There are kind and gentle gods. Mine isn't one of those.
We are born knowing what to do. We must only act.
The sea is ripe for battle.
There is joy in food... and fighting.
My god doesn't want peace.
The ocean is calm. It is our desires that stir it.
Many die. Worthy souls find new forms.
